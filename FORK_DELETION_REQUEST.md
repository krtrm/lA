# Courtesy Request to Fork Owners

You forked my repository a while ago when it was public under the MIT license. I’ve since made the upstream repository private and I’m consolidating the project internally. While I understand the previous MIT grant allows you to keep using that snapshot, I’d appreciate it—purely as a courtesy—if you would delete your fork (and any local copies if you no longer need them) to avoid outdated public variants.

There were no problems with your use; I’m just trying to minimize drift and potential confusion.

If you’re willing, a quick confirmation would help. Thanks for considering it.
